# signup-form

## good
- farely straightforward. was able to progress at a good rate
- went with the std designn rather than my own. 
- flex formatting worked pretty well
- overall formatting pretty well too.
- first use of @font-family to refernece a downloaded font.
- first use of psuedo classes.


## challenges
- difficulty with how to position the left image. first added as a img in the left pane, but then switched to a body background image with content over it.
- had trouble with the focus formatting. turns out there is :focus and :focus-visable and the latter seemed to have president. also, the latter had a default outline rather than a border. this outline was on top of my border so it looked like my border was not working.
- the size of my input section and boxes do not flex in size.  that may be an enhancement that could be done.
